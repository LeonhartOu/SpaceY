               Where Does Space Begin?
           </p>
           <p>
               The universe began some 13.7 billion years ago in an event called the Big Bang. It was not an explosion (as is often depicted in some artwork) but more of a sudden expansion from a tiny pinpoint of matter called a singularity. From that beginning, the universe has expanded and grown more complex.

                What is the Universe Made of? 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is one of those questions that has an answer that is quite mind-expanding. Basically, the universe consists of galaxies and the objects they contain: stars, planets, nebulae, black holes and other dense objects. The early universe was largely hydrogen with some helium and lithium, and the first stars formed from that helium. As they evolved and died, they created heavier and heavier elements, which formed second- and third-generation stars and their planets.

                What Happens to a Human Body in a Vacuum?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do the movies get it right? Well, not actually. Most of them depict messy, explosive endings, or other dramatic events. The truth is while being in space without a spacesuit WILL kill whoever is unlucky enough to be in that situation (unless the person gets rescued very, very quickly), their body probably won't explode. It's more likely to freeze and suffocate first. Still not a great way to go.

                What Happens When Black Holes Collide?
            </p>
            <p>
                People are fascinated by black holes and their actions in the universe. Until very recently, it's been tough for scientists to measure what happens when black holes collide. Certainly, it's a very energetic event and would give off a lot of radiation. However, another cool thing happens: the collision creates gravitational waves and those can be measured! Those waves are also created when neutron stars collide!
